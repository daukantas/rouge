(fn [] a)

The FN builtin should search for a nearby "A".  If not found, compiler
exception!

In any other instance, we can resolve it then and there -- exciting
implications for speed, as we can know where to set it without having to call
Context#lookup.

(fn [a] a)

This implies we need to be able to find the "A" in this context.

I'm not sure how cromulent it is having one context created for the FN.  It
should probably be one context per execution.  The question is whether these
two cases are distinguishable in reality.
