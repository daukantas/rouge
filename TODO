miscellaeny
-----------
- boot.rg
- package as a gem?
- readline autocomplete
- MACROEXPAND
- run rouge specs from rspec
- omit Ruby from tracebacks?
- better read errors
- better exceptions/errors

ruby interop
------------
- accessing the scope/self (DSLs!)
- proc or lambda? setting arity.

"hard" tasks
------------
- have a core "apply" function which can be used by eval, defmacro, etc.
- re-org to allow "compilation" phase: (defmacro a [] b) without a "b" in context should fail immediately.

core lang
---------
- dequoting
- multi-form defn: (defn x ([a] ...) ([a b] ...))
- seqs
- vars
  - atoms, refs, agents
- freeze vectors, lists where approriate
- (. x y)
- #(puts %)
- destructuring (in FN, LET, everywhere else)
- rest of the clojure core API (maybe even in clojure.core ns)
- clojure-ish IO libraries which expose async IO
- string interpol (clojurish. hum. maybe not?)
- defprotocol -- looks important! ISeq, ISeqable, ISequential and what have you.
