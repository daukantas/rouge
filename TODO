NEXT:
- destructuring (in FN, LET, everywhere else)
- refactor DEFN, DEFMACRO, LET, BINDING(?) to make use of above
- may be faster for general wrapper classes to inherit Struct? seems to be a bit magic wrt. speed.

miscellaeny
-----------
- MACROEXPAND
- SPEED test. run core specs a few times and time.
- everything in ::Rouge should be accessible via rouge.builtin
- organise boot.rg
- test the whole core
- omit Ruby from tracebacks?
- better exceptions/errors
- readline autocomplete
- package as a gem?

ruby interop
------------
- accessing the scope/self (DSLs!)
- proc or lambda? setting ARITY.
- DEFN/DEFMACRO/etc. should create strict lambdas, but FN/#() should not.
    Emulate by accepting |*a| and selecting ourselves how strict we want to be.

"hard" tasks
------------
- have a core "apply" function which can be used by eval, defmacro, etc.
- re-org to allow "compilation" phase: (defmacro a [] b) without a "b" in
  context should fail immediately.
  - probably generic walking would be nice here
  - macro interpretation in one pass before regular evaluation: this would
    effect the desired outcome, I think?
  - no, (defn a [] b) or just (fn [] b) (without "b" in ctx) should be similar.
  - the macro interpretation would effect a large speed increase, however.

core lang
---------
- NON-dynamic/special vars
- INTERN
- FOR
- (def a/b) should not create #'user/a/b, lol.
- multi-form defn: (defn x ([a] ...) ([a b] ...))
- seqs
- atoms (actually multithreaded), refs, agents
- (. x y)
- rest of the clojure core API (maybe even in clojure.core ns)
- clojure-ish IO libraries which expose async IO
- defprotocol -- looks important! ISeq, ISeqable, ISequential and what have
  you.
- metadata on all collections (not just symbols)
